                                    Code Kreigers was started in year 2014. Code kreigers 3.0 was a massive success with more than 200 participations. It was a technical and fun event with 3 offline and 1 online round. The winners of online round were given direct entry to the second round of offline event. First round was a treasure hunt. For the first time in the history of Central India an app based treasure hunt was organised. Second round was a debugging round. Third round was coding round. Coding is not only about making complex code rather it's an art. Students enjoyed the exposure to the journey of coding world.
